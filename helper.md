# virtualenv

[virtualenv](http://pypi.org/project/virtualenv) is a tool to create isolated Python environments. virtualenv creates a folder which contains all the necessary executables to use the packages that a Python project would need.

It can be used standalone, in place of Pipenv.

Install virtualenv via pip:

```
$ pip install virtualenv
```

Test your installation:

```
$ virtualenv --version
```

## Basic Usage

1. Create a virtual environment for a project:

```
$ cd project_folder
$ virtualenv venv
```

`virtualenv venv` will create a folder in the current directory which will contain the Python executable files, and a copy of the `pip` library which you can use to install other packages. The name of the virtual environment (in this case, it was `venv`) can be anything; omitting the name will place the files in the current directory instead.

> Note
>
> ‘venv’ is the general convention used globally. As it is readily available in ignore files (eg: .gitignore’)

This creates a copy of Python in whichever directory you ran the command in, placing it in a folder named `venv`.

You can also use the Python interpreter of your choice (like `python2.7`).

```
$ virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 venv
```

or change the interpreter globally with an env variable in `~/.bashrc`:

```
$ export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python2.7
```

1. To begin using the virtual environment, it needs to be activated:

```
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

The name of the current virtual environment will now appear on the left of the prompt (e.g. `(venv)Your-Computer:project_folder UserName$`) to let you know that it’s active. From now on, any package that you install using pip will be placed in the `venv` folder, isolated from the global Python installation.

For Windows, the same command mentioned in step 1 can be used to create a virtual environment. However, activating the environment requires a slightly different command.

Assuming that you are in your project directory:

```
C:\Users\SomeUser\project_folder> venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install packages using the `pip` command:

```
$ pip install requests
```

1. If you are done working in the virtual environment for the moment, you can deactivate it:

```
$ deactivate
```

This puts you back to the system’s default Python interpreter with all its installed libraries.

To delete a virtual environment, just delete its folder. (In this case, it would be `rm -rf venv`.)

After a while, though, you might end up with a lot of virtual environments littered across your system, and it’s possible you’ll forget their names or where they were placed.

> Note:
>
> Python has included venv module from version 3.3. For more details: [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).



## First Perform `Subnet Scan`

```python
nm = nmap.PortScanner()

nm.scan(hosts='10.0.0.0/24', arguments='-n -sP -PE -PA21,23,80,3389')
hosts_list = [(x, nm[x]['status']['state']) for x in nm.all_hosts()]
for host, status in hosts_list:
    print(host, status)
```
This will return the IP address of active hosts that the
